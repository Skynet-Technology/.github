Yes, we are building Skynet! (Not the terminator one :D) and the best part! We just started, a little over **2 Months**.
That's when we made our first commit, the first leap of faith. We haven't done much, but it's honest work and we hope to reach limits like no other! 
We are proud to be part of the work of millions of **developers**, **companies** and **robots** across the solar system 🪐.

### 🍿 What we build?

We creative redemptive and not-exploitive software, which is in the 💗 heart of Skynet and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

- [The Sky Foundation](https://www.sky-net.ml/developers/) Building software to help churchs, christians and people all around 🌍
- Hypebot, the new way to build converstioanl forms that go-to the moon 🚀
- Peep's And Founders is a cool NFT collection! 🏄 based on a governing-based community

### 🦦 Our Ethos

We have strong values and ethos when it comes to our company, which we refuse to break 🎤:

- Our lord, Jesus Christ comes first - in-everything!
- Skynet does not own your data. You own it!
- Empowering global citizens!
- Build a better web
